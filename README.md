    <h2 id="my-story"> My Story </h2>
  <p class="centerpx"> Hi there! I’m <span class="green">John Deere</span>. I was born in Vermont and apprenticed to a blacksmith there. However, the economy there kinda went kaput, so I moved to the Midwest, where many farmers were frustrated with the plows the used. Thankfully, I have a solution to their woes. </p>
    <h2 id="they-suck"> Why wooden/cast-iron plows suck </h2>
  <p class="centerpx"> People currently (mostly) use cast-iron plows, which tended to be somewhat fragile. Also, dirt would cling to it, and you’d have to stop <em> <strong> every few seconds </strong> </em>to scrape it off. Imagine how much time you’d have to spend over an easily solvable problem! </p>
    <h2 id="my-solution"> My solution </h2>
  <p class="centerpx"> We carefully designed and constructed a sturdier plow. Also, instead of using a cast-iron blade, we have sharp, strong, <strong>SAW BLADE!!! </strong> The sharp steel of our new plow blade increases the speed of the plow and repels annoying soil that would otherwise stick to it. </p>
    <h2 id="how-it-works"> How it works </h2>
  <p class="centerpx"> The steel of the saw blade prevents soil from clinging to it. It’s also sharper, which increases the plowing speed. All in all, it saves <strong>TREMENDOUS</strong> amounts of time and its more durable! If you want more info, here's a diagram of our amazing product!!!</p> 
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"><img class="img" src="https://i.postimg.cc/T3XrLdsS/final-plow-diagram.jpg" alt="plow-diagram"> </a>
    <h2 id="the-market"> The Market </h2>
  <p class="centerpx"> Our market consists mainly of small farmers. This may not <em> sound </em> impressive, but keep in mind that basically <em>everyone, everywhere, </em> is a small farmer. In other words: <span class="green">there’s serious cash to be made here and you’d be an idiot not to invest. </span> </p>
    <h2 id="comp-sucks"> Why the competition sucks </h2>
  <p class="centerpx"> As I’ve mentioned before, cast-iron plows are inefficient and horrible. <br> Wooden plows? Pfft. They break so often you’d probably spend more time fixing one than using one. <br> Also, if you invest in us, we’ll be pretty much the <span class="green">only major plow company on Earth.</span> <br> In other words, there basically <em>is </em>no competition. Chances are, there never really will be, either, because we've patented the <em>blade </em> along with the plow, so making anything even remotely similar to our product will be illegal for a really <em>really <strong>really</strong> </em> long time.</p>
    <h2 id="advertising-and-marketing"> Advertising and Marketing </h2>
  <p class="centerpx"> I’ll use <span class="green">10% </span>of our budget to print and distribute flyers, pay for newspaper ads, and perform public demonstrations to spread the word. Trust me, people will listen.</p>
    <h2 id="prices-costs-and-profits"> Prices, costs, and profits </h2>
  <p class="centerpx"> Steel-tipped plows will cost around $5-6 dollars to make, and they’ll sell for around $10-12. Given our expansive potential customer base, profits will probably be through the roof.</p>
    <h2 id="deal"> Let's make a deal! </h2>
  <p class="centerpx"> To wrap everything up, we’d like <span class="green"> $50,000 </span> to build a factory, pay workers, build plows, and advertise. In return, expect a <span class="green">25% return on monthly profits </span>for two years. <span class="green">It’s a great deal!</span></p>
